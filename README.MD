# Core-Web

## Demo

Check out the demo at [http://dotcms.github.io/core-web/](http://dotcms.github.io/core-web/). 

If you have an up to date instance of the [Rules Engine branch](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/tree/master-3.5) 
of dotCMS Core running locally you can point to it by adding the Base URL of your server to the link. For example
[http://dotcms.github.io/core-web/?baseUrl=http://localhost:8080](http://dotcms.github.io/core-web/?baseUrl=http://localhost:8080)

## About

DotCMS Core-Web is a Typescript based Angular 2 application. The project is divided into two primary layers: an API 
that provides convenience methods for accessing the DotCMS Core ReST API, and views. 

As of this writing the view layer uses [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) to provide widgets and input components,
and Angular 2 alpha 44 for framework and scaffolding (templating, dependency injection, etc).   


## To Run:

  * Checkout this repo
  * Update Node to at least v0.12.x and NPM to 2.14.x
  * Install global NPM hooks
  * Run NPM Install
  * Run JSPM Install
  * Run a server
  
```Shell
git clone git@github.com:dotCMS/core-web.git
npm -g install typescript@^1.5.3
npm install
jspm install
npm run itest
```

To run for development purposes you should execute the itest target. This will open your browser to the integration tests,
and will start a server on http://localhost:9000 that by default will proxy all ReST requests to http://localhost:8080, which is where you should
have an up-to-date instance of dotCMS running.
 
The `itest` target will also maintain a watch task that will compile your files when changes are detected. You will need
to refresh the test page manually to re-run the integration tests.

To see the main site as you develop, open another browser tab to http://localhost:9000/index-dev.html

## The Build System

  * Gulp with NPM script targets for convenience.
  * JSPM is used to bundle. This is subject to change as Angular2 now explicitly does not support JSPM.  

## API Layer

  * WhatWG for HTTP requests. 
  * Angular2 for DI, EventEmitter
  * Reactive, using [ReactiveX/RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS), which is included with Angular2. Currently Beta. 

## View Layer
  
  * Angular2: 
    * Templating, WebComponents, DI
  * Angular Material Styles: 
    * For the convenient Flex Layout styles. See [https://material.angularjs.org/HEAD/layout/container]()
  * Semantic-UI:
    * Input elements and styling
  

### Components
 
#### 'Widget' Components versus 'Feature' Components 

Widgets are bits of frequently reused functionality, such as input components, layout helpers/templates, etc. Feature
components are blocks of functionality. A Card element is a Widget Component. A Person-Card would be a Feature Component.
 
Verbiage subject to change. 

#### Widgets - Input elements and layout templates



##### List of Widgets (links to demo pages)
  * [Input Toggle](http://localhost:9000/build/view/components/input/toggle/index.html)
  
  For all demos, make sure to open the browser's console in order to view log messages.

#### Feature Components
  * [Rules Engine](http://localhost:9000/index-dev.html)



## Developing
 
### IDE Support
 
This project contains the IntelliJ/WebStorm project files which JetBrains recommends be shared among developers. 
Rather than using 'create new project', simply open the project with IntelliJ >= 14.1.2 or WebStorm >= 10.0.0.3.

For the most part, these files only change when there are legitimate updates to the project. Sometimes, particularly 
as version updates occur, there are additions to some of the files. 

### Clean often

If you update and something breaks, try updating the project dependencies before anything else. Especially if 
`{projectRoot}/config.js` or `{projectRoot}/package.json` have been modified by the update. If that doesn't work and it
makes sense (or you don't know what else to try) you might consider deleting your `{projectRoot}/jspm_packages` and 
`{projectRoot}/node_modules` directories and rerunning `npm install` and `jspm install`. And keep an eye on jspm install,
in case it asks you to manually install a bootloader. 

### Patterns and Practices

#### Top Down

A child should never know about its parent component. The only exception to this is for Model objects. A child model may 
need to maintain a reference to its parent model type, such as for an 'is owned by' relationship. However, the related 
child Service should not be aware of the parent Service. 
 
Similarly, in the view layer, a component that represents the child should avoid directly modifying any service 
related to the parent, or modifying the parent model object.  Use Observers and EventEmitters to communicate changes
that parent components should be aware of.

A good way to think of this style of development is to consider a bunch of newborn puppies. They know exactly nothing about 
the world around them. The are utterly unaware even of the concept of 'mother'. But when they cry (emit an event), things happen.
Warmth, food, cleaning.
 
View components and API Services are puppies. They are blind and naive. They know nothing about the world around
them, only the small bit of the world under their control. If they need to change something that is not encompassed 
within that world then their only hope is to emit an event and hope something larger than them knows what to do with it.


#### Design for off-line first

Each View component should have a demo page that uses fake/mocked models to demonstrate functionality. This forces a 
development model that allows testing of view components without the need of a backend server, or even a 
mock persistence layer. 
  
 
### Troubleshooting

When all else fails, try running `gulp clean` and deleting the jspm_packages and node_modules directories, and then re-run `npm install` and `jspm install`.
